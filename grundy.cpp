/*
• Player chooses a game and makes a move in it
Grundy number of a position is xor of grundy
numbers of positions in summed games.
• Player chooses a non-empty subset of games
(possibly, all) and makes moves in all of them
A position is losing iff each game is in a losing
position.
• Player chooses a proper subset of games (not
empty and not all), and makes moves in all chosen
ones. A position is losing iff grundy numbers
of all games are equal.
• Player must move in all games, and loses if
can’t move in some game A position is losing
if any of the games is in a losing position.
