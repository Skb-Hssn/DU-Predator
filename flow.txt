- Dinic Complexity : V^2 * E
- Cut Set : A set of edges which when removed source and sink gets disconnected
- Cost of Cut Set : Summation of capacities of edges
- Min cut : The cut set with the minimum cost
- Min Cut = Max flow
- Lower bound on edges : 
    - important to be acyclic
    - no need to maximize flow
    - lower bound 'l' on edge u->v
        - cap[u][v] -= l
        - add a super sink ss with u with cap[u][ss] = l, a super source with v with
            cap[tt][v] = l
        - add an edge with original sink to original source with cap = inf
        - if each edge outgoing from super source is completely filled, it is possible
    - maximize and minimization of flow with demands:
